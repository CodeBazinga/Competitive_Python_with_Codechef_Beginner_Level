    "Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers.\n",
    "He started testing the robot by letting it move on a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of N commands, \n",
    "described by a string S with length N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', \n",
    "denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing x by 1) or to the \n",
    "right (increasing x by 1), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? \n",
    "A point p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or \n",
    "after executing some command is x=p.\n",

    "1) The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T\n",
